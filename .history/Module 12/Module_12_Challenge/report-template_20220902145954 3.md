# Credit Risk Analysis Report (Module 12 Challenge)

## Overview of the Analysis

* Analyzing credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. Various techniques can be used to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. The dataset used was of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

* The financial data used was activity from the lending services company. The data was provided by LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. The data was used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

* The balance of the labels was checked with the `value_counts` function. This was to identify if the data was balanced or imbalanced. The data was imbalanced with the initial model and then modified to be balanced with the `RandomOverSampler` algorithms in the second model.

* The dataset was split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function.  The training set was over sampled using the `RandomOverSampler` algorithm.  

* The stages of the machine learning process used were as follows:

* The `LogisticRegression` model was used to train and evaluate the model using the balanced accuracy score, precision, and recall scores.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
