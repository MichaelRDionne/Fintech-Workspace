# Group Project #2: Emotion Recognition using a Neural Network

## Determine a person's emotion based on facial pattern analysis

### 1. An optimized NN wil be determined by implementation of different ML classifiers

- #### Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nguyendaitruongthanh/facial-emotion-detection-with-cnn/data) contains different expressions of the human face (happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprise, fear, disgust)

- #### The training set contains 28,709 images and the test set contains 7,177 images of facial expressions

- #### (We can add ML optimization in here later)

### 2. Picture is taken in Streamlit and sent to our optimized Neural Network

### 3. The Neural Network will determine the emotion of the person in the picture

### 4. Applications of emotional recognition can guide financial institutions into providing intelligent-driven financial service

- ### Can skip learning the customer experience and get real-time feedback on customer satisfaction with service

- ### Unhappy customers can be identified and can be forwarded directly to the senior bank manager

## Summary of Findings

- ### The model using the RMS optimizer & ReLu Activation was the most accurate with 53% accuracy and had the least loss of 1.22

- ### This model was used to predict the emotion of the person in the picture

- ### The model incorrectly predicted the emotion in the picture as "sad" when the person was actually "happy"
