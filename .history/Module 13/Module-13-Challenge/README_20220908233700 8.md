### Three technical deliverables were created to accomplish the following

- ###  Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model

- ###  Deliverable 2: Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile, train, and evaluate a binary classification model

- ###  Deliverable 3: Optimize the model
